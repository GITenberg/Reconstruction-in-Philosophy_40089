description: '"The author presents an interpretation of the reconstruction of ideas
  and ways of thought now going on in philosophy. While the lectures cannot avoid
  revealing the marks of the particular standpoint of their author, the aim is to
  exhibit the general contrasts between older and newer types of philosophic problems
  rather than to make a partisan plea in behalf of any one specific solution of these
  problems. Dewey has tried for the most part to set forth the forces which make intellectual
  reconstruction inevitable and to prefigure some of the lines upon which it must
  proceed"--Foreword. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).'
